## About
I'm lucixno and I typically work with JavaScript and Python. I started learning how to code about 2022-23, when I was interested in making discord selfbots/nukers. I'm still a beginner when it goes in the direction of programming. Besides programming I also like to design banners and logos. Hopefully in the future, I can get into graphicdesign.

## Current projects
* [Soulreaper](https://github.com/lucixno/soulreaper-v2) - discord nuker
* [ZEB](https://github.com/lucixno/zeb) - wait... 

## Languages I know
* JavaScript
* Python
* C#
